Huffman
=======

This repository contains various programs that do Huffman encoding and decoding. The purpose is
educational. A Huffman program is simple enough to be understood by a student who spends an
evening (or a weekend) studying the code, yet rich enough to show off a number of interesting
technological issues. This repository thus serves a purpose similar to my Hexdump repository: as
a showcase of various programming technologies.
